# Machine Learning Projects Repository

**_This repository is part of the coursework for MITx 6.86x: Machine Learning with Python - From Linear Models to Deep Learning._**

This repository contains machine learning projects developed as part of the MITx course **6.86x: Machine Learning with Python - From Linear Models to Deep Learning**. Each project, designed as a practical exploration of machine learning concepts, resides in a separate branch, focusing on different areas from sentiment analysis to image classification.

## Repository Structure

The main branch serves as an entry point, providing instructions on accessing and working with each project. Currently, the repository contains the following projects:

1. **Sentiment Analysis Classifier** (Branch: `sentiment-analysis`):  
   A project focused on classifying Amazon food product reviews as positive or negative using linear classifiers.

2. **Digit Recognition on the MNIST Dataset** (Branch: `digit-recognition`):  
   A project for classifying handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset using both traditional machine learning methods and neural networks.

## How to Use This Repository

### Step 1: Clone the Repository

To access the entire repository locally, clone it using:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ullas-aradhya/MIT-ML-projects.git
cd MIT-ML-projects
```

### Step 2: Switch to a Project Branch

Each project is located in its own branch. After cloning the repository, switch to the desired branch:

- **Sentiment Analysis Classifier**:

  ```bash
  git checkout sentiment_analysis-branch
  ```

- **Digit Recognition on the MNIST Dataset**:

  ```bash
  git checkout Digit_Recognition
  ```

### Step 3: Follow Project-Specific Instructions

Each branch has a dedicated README file detailing the setup, installation, and usage instructions for the respective project. After switching to a branch, open the README file to get detailed guidance on setting up the environment, running the code, and understanding the project’s structure.


### Step 4: Run the Project Code

Once you’ve reviewed the instructions, set up the environment, and installed the necessary dependencies, you’re ready to run the project. Each README file will outline specific commands to execute the code.

### Merging Updates

If you have your own updates or enhancements, create a new branch to keep track of changes. You can then commit updates and push them to your forked repository.

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome! If you’d like to add features, improve code, or enhance documentation, please create a pull request from your forked branch. Ensure each update is properly documented.

## License

This repository is intended for educational purposes as part of MITx’s **6.86x: Machine Learning with Python** course. Please use the projects responsibly, adhering to academic integrity guidelines if these projects are part of a course or assignment.
